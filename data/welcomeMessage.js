module.exports = `I'm a friendly countdown bot, and I'm very simple to use.
Simply call my name (\`@thecount\`) and I'll tell you how many days are left until an event or trip to a destination of your choosing.
Each countdown just needs either a destination, an event name, or both, plus the date.

To reset, simply say:

\`@thecount reset date: <the date, formatted YYYY-MM-DD>, destination: <your destination>, event: <your event name>\`

I'll let you know if you got it right!
To see this message again, simply say "@thecount help".
