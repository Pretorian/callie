# Callie the Calendar Corgi

Callie is a slackbot that counts down the days to a given event. The way she works is extremely simple, and I've tried to support a variety of countdown-related functions. Everything is pretty much outta the box. I was surprised that there wasn't already a good countdown bot, but whatever. Enjoy, and feel free to contribute.

## TODOs

[] Refactor message parsing to allow greater flexibility in commands
[] Figure out why Callie's initial welcome message doesn't always send (likely a channel permission issue)
[] Allow for time-based countdowns (i.e., set the event time as well as date)
[] ...
[] Profit
